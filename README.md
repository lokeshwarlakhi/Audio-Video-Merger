1.  Application will take the .rar / .zip file from the user and extract folders named `audio` and `video`  from the zip file then start the combining segment ,and return a .rar or .zip file with output folder in it, to download.

2. Application can also take the individual folders from the user and do the same combining part and return a .rar or .zip file with output folder in it, to download.
